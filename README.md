Implementation of S.O.L.I.D Design Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle: This means that one class should only have one responsibility.
* Open/Closed Principle: Software entities such as classes, functions, modules should be open for extension but not modification.
* Liskov substitution principle: objects of the same superclass should be able to substitute each other without breaking existing code.
* Interface Segregation Principle: If an interface grows too big with mixed functionality, it makes sense to segregate it into multiple smaller interfaces.
* Dependency Inversion principle: higher level modules in a program must not be tightly coupled with the lower-level modules, Both modules must depend on abstractions. This         principle provides a mechanism to build loosely coupled software modules.
